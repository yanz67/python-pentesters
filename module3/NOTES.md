## Network Programming

### Socket programming 
    - TCP and UDP Sockets
        - Regular Servers and Clients 
    - Raw Sockets
        - Sniffing and Injection
### Simple TCP Server and Client
- Socket is a network endpoint for communication between two more more entities
- Using socket module in Python
    - Create TCP socket which will be listening on a specific port
        - `tcpSocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)`
            - `socket.AF_INET` Address Family which is for internet application usually AF_INET
                - A pair (host, port) is used for the AF_INET address family, where host is a string representing either 
                a hostname in Internet domain notation like 'daring.cwi.nl' or an IPv4 address like '100.50.200.5', 
                and port is an integer.
            - `socket.SOCK_STREAM` Socket type (SOCK_STREAM for TCP)
        - Bind a socket to a port which also includes binding to a specific interface
            - `tcpSocket.bind(("0.0.0.0", 8000))`
                - bind method accepts a tuple with interface IP address and port
        - Call `listen` to start accepting clients
            - `tcpsocket.listen(2)`
        - Call `accept` method to start waiting for connections
            - `accept` returns a tuple when client connects `(client, (ip, port))`
                - with each client connects accept will return a different client socket with IP and Port
                - accept is blocking call and will wait until client connects
        - send data to the client using client object
            - `client.data('hello world)`
        - receive data from client
            - `data = client.recv(2048)` providing the size of the buffer
    - Reusing port and ip address immediately after a program exists    
        - To insure fast reuse you can set an option on the socket for address reuse
            - `tcpSocket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)`
    - Create TCP client which connects to a server
        - Create a socket
        - call `connect` to connect to the server `tcpSocket.connect((IP, PORT))`

### SocketServer
- Framework in Python to create TCP and UDP servers
- Does all the basic steps in the background
- Comes in handy of you want to create a server to lure a client and analyzer its behaviour
- Module Usage
    - Create a subclass of `BaseRequestHandler`
    - Override `hadle()` to process request
    - Call `handle_request()` or `serve_forever()` to process clients
    - For TCP Servers
     - `self.request` is the client socket
     - `self.client_address` is the client details
